# revops-dashboard
A portfolio-ready, AI-assisted RevOps dashboard that simulates real-world GTM workflows using Streamlit, Claude, and GPT-4. This project highlights how AI can accelerate internal tool creation and metric analysis — even in the absence of a formal CRM or MarTech stack.

## ✅ What This Demonstrates

- My ability to scope and design a full RevOps dashboard from scratch
- Strategic use of AI (Claude, GPT-4) for schema design, logic, and code generation
- Practical application of key RevOps metrics like conversion rates, velocity, and weighted forecasting
- Comfort building lightweight internal tools without engineering support
- Familiarity with modern tools like Streamlit, GitHub, and Python-based analytics
